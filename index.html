                    <p style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Lacquer;">
                        Winnie-the-Pooh is a fictional anthropomorphic teddy bear created by English author A. A. Milne. 
                        <br><br>
                        The first collection of stories about the character was the book Winnie-the-Pooh (1926), and this was followed by The House at Pooh Corner (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children's verse book When We Were Very Young (1924) and many more in Now We Are Six (1927). All four volumes were illustrated by E. H. Shepard.
                        <br><br>
                        The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, including Alexander Lenard's Latin translation, Winnie ille Pu, which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on The New York Times Best Seller list.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1961, Walt Disney Productions licensed certain film and other rights of Milne's Winne-the-Pooh stories from the estate of A. A. Milne and the licensing agent Stephen Slesinger.Inc. and adapted the Pooh stories, using the unhyphenated name "Winnie the Pooh", into a series of features that would eventually become one of its most successful franchises.
                        <br><br>
                        In popular film adaptations, Pooh has been voiced by actors Sterling Holloway, Hal Smith, and Jim Cummings in English, and Yevgeny Leonov in Russian.

            <h3 style="font-size: 30px;font-family: Fredericka the Great">KNOW MORE ABOUT THE CHARACTER</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;font-family: Lacquer">A. A. Milne named the character Winnie-the-Pooh after a         teddy bear owned by his son, Christopher Robin Milne, on whom the character Christopher Robin was          based. The rest of Christopher Robin Milne's toys – Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, and Tigger – were          incorporated into Milne's stories. Two more characters, Owl and Rabbit, were created by Milne's            imagination, while Gopher was added to the Disney version. Christopher Robin's toy bear is on display      at the Main Branch of the New York Public Library in New York City.
                    <br><br>
                    Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often saw at London Zoo, and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River, Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear "Winnie" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much-loved attraction there. Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;padding:10px;font-family: Lacquer">Pooh videos, soft toys and other              merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges      from Beanie and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh, Disney markets      Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E.H. Shepard's illustrations.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger.
